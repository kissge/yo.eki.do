You can think of it as alphabets. There are only 48 <em>hiragana</em> (well, depending on how you count). It is possible to write everything just with <em>hiragana</em>. Young children and Japanese learners do that. Each <em>hiragana</em> has just one pronunciation (well, mostly).</li>\n<li><strong><em>Katakana</em></strong> (カタカナ, 片仮名) is similar to <em>hiragana</em>. Alphabets. Every <em>hiragana</em> has its correspondence in <em>katakana</em> (just like Latin alphabets have upper case and lower case). <em>Katakana</em> is used for certain use cases e.g. borrowed words. Each <em>katakana</em> has just one pronunciation (mostly).</li>\n<li><strong><em>Kanji</em></strong> (漢字) is the most difficult one. Originally, <em>kanji</em> came from China; that’s why Japan, China, Taiwan, and some other Asian countries use similar (but slightly different) characters. Each <em>kanji</em> has usually multiple pronunciations. There are several thousands of <em>kanji</em>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Using these, we can write Japan as:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>in <em>hiragana</em>: にほん (read: nihon)</li>\n<li>in <em>katakana</em>: ニホン (read: nihon)</li>\n<li>in <em>kanji</em>: 日本 (read: nihon or nippon)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note that also にっぽん (nippon) is the word meaning Japan.\n<em>Kanji</em> 日本 can be read as both nihon and nippon.</p>\n<p>Another thing to note is that にほん (nihon) can mean different things e.g. 二本 (e.g. ペンが二本ある (There are <strong>two</strong> pens))</p>\n<h1>How to type Japanese on a keyboard</h1>\n<p>Among many Japanese input methods, the most popular one is <strong><em>Rōmaji</em> input</strong> (ローマ字入力).\n<em>Rōmaji</em> means Latin alphabets.</p>\n<p>In <em>Rōmaji</em> input, we take the following steps to type a word e.g. 楽しい (read: tanoshii):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Type <em>hiragana</em> using romanized Japanese pronunciation\n<ul>\n<li>Hit <code>T</code> <code>A</code> <code>N</code> <code>O</code> <code>S</code> <code>H</code> <code>I</code> <code>I</code> keys, in order.</li>\n<li>At this point, the screen shows <em>hiragana</em> たのしい.</li>\n<li>Now IME is in typing state.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Convert them to appropriate <em>kanji</em> (and <em>katakana</em>), choosing from possibly multiple candidates\n<ul>\n<li>Hit the Space bar.</li>\n<li>IME moves to conversion state.</li>\n<li>The screen shows conversion candidates like 楽しい, 愉しい, たのしい (no conversion), タノシイ, etc.</li>\n<li>Choosing a candidate is usually done by hitting the Space bar multiple times, or arrow keys.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Finish the conversion\n<ul>\n<li>Hit Enter key to finalize the conversion.</li>\n<li>IME moves to a normal state.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Many people use IME software that is shipped with OS, i.e. Microsoft Japanese IME or macOS Japanese IME.\nSome faddy geeks install another one they want, like Google Japanese IME.\n(Disclaimer: I worked at Microsoft global text input team before 2017 🤗)</p>\n<p>Since OS X 10.11 El Capitan, a new functionality named live conversion (ライブ変換) was introduced.\nWith this feature on, the text is automatically converted to the most likely candidate as you type each key, without hitting the Space bar.\nThe candidate selection is usually OK, but you can move to conversion state with the Space bar if wrong, just as before.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://iphone-mania.jp/news-457657/\"><img src=\"https://iphone-mania.jp/uploads/2022/05/livetranslation.gif\" alt=\"Live conversion\"></a></p>\n<p>Image from: <a href=\"https://iphone-mania.jp/news-457657/\">https://iphone-mania.jp/news-457657/</a></p>\n<p>There are also some other input methods than <em>Rōmaji</em> input, including direct <em>hiragana</em> input (かな入力).\nDirect <em>hiragana</em> input can be used by young children since it doesn’t need knowledge of the Latin alphabets.</p>\n<h1>How to type Japanese on a smartphone</h1>\n<p>On smartphones, some people use <em>Rōmaji</em> input with a QWERTY touch keyboard, but the most popular method is <strong>flick input</strong> (フリック入力).</p>\n<p>There are many variants of flick input method, but they usually use 4 columns × 3 rows grid key layouts just like the numerical keypad.\nEach key is mapped to 5 different <em>hiragana</em>, e.g. か (ka), き (ki), く (ku), け (ke), こ (ko).\nSimply tapping the key inputs the first one.\nYou can input the other four by swiping in the corresponding direction, starting from the key top.</p>\n<iframe style=\"width: 745px; height: 420px; max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BhD6r8NKlmY\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n","headline":"Unlike Latin alphabetic scripts, the Japanese language has several thousands of characters.This mean"}
